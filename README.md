# Webmap

Webmap shows points on the world map that import from folium 
We import a file called world.json that includes information about populations in the world and we represent them by colors on each country.
if the populations is below 10M the country will be painted as green, if between 10M to 20M the country will be painted as red , else orange.


The output of the HTML file will be as below:
